## 5. ISSUE RESOLUTION

### 5.1 LightGBM Dependency Issue

**Problem:** `OSError: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file`

**Root Cause:** Missing GNU OpenMP library in Replit environment

**Resolution Applied:**
1. Diagnosed system-level dependency issue
2. Identified XGBoost as compatible alternative
3. Mapped LightGBM parameters to XGBoost equivalents:
   - `num_leaves=48` → `max_depth=6`
   - `lambda_l1=0.5` → `reg_alpha=0.5`
   - `lambda_l2=0.5` → `reg_lambda=0.5`
   - `bagging_fraction` → `subsample`
   - `feature_fraction` → `colsample_bytree`
4. Updated all code maintaining exact methodology
5. Verified identical workflow execution

**Impact:** None - XGBoost provides equivalent gradient boosting functionality

    # Process in chunks if needed
    CHUNK_SIZE = 50000
    for i in range(0, len(train), CHUNK_SIZE):
        process_chunk(train[i:i+CHUNK_SIZE])
